# Move Tab Hotkeys

### This extension provides hotkeys for the following actions:

|Key|Action|Description|
|---|------|-----------|
|Alt+Shift+Left|Move tab left|Moves the current tab one spot to the left. If it is at the start of the tab bar, it wraps to the end.|
|Alt+Shift+Right|Move tab right|Moves the current tab one spot to the right. If it is at the end of the tab bar, it wraps to the start.|
|Alt+Shift+0|Move tab to start|Moves the current tab to the start of the tab bar.|
|Alt+Shift+9|Move tab to end|Moves the current tab to the end of the tab bar.|

### Pinned and un-pinned tabs:
For all of the above, pinned and un-pinned tabs are treated separately.

Pinned tabs are kept in one block at the start of the tab bar, and un-pinned tabs are in a second block to the right. Whenever a tab is moved left/right or to start/end, that move happens within the part of the tab bar corresponding to it's pinned status.
